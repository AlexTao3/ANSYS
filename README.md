# ANSYS
The project is considered as a thin plate with two hexagonal cut-outs that may be used as a wrench, as illustrated in Figure 1. The plate is attached to the surfaces in the right cut-out, B, by solid black lines, and is subjected to a vertical concentrated force operating on a distant point in the center of cut-out A. (point O). The goal is to lower the part's mass while meets the following requirements:
1.	Maintaining the maximum equivalent stress below the material's yield stress, which is 163 MPa.
2.	Maximum vertical displacement within 0.5 mm.

During the design, it is critical that the part retains all the solid black lines seen in Figure 1 following the procedure. Except for the solid black lines, all other sections of the component can be optimized, modified, or eliminated.
